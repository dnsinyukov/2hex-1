											<h2 style="font-size: 120%; color: #6610f2">Are American skateboard decks better than European or Chinese skateboard decks?</h2>
											</p>
											<p>
												It does not depend where a skateboard deck is made, but what it is made of and by whom it is made.
												All three continents have many manufacturers of terrible skateboard deck quality; And all three continents have
												a very few great quality skateboard deck manufacturers. <br>
												Most pro level skateboard decks are made in China. By moving the skateboard deck production from USA to China,
												some of the world's best skateboard company's have transferred the oroginal production know-how from USA to China.
												Since then, a few Chinese factories have been spending a lot on research and development to further better the deck quality and
												reduce production costs. Due to the high labour costs in Chinese skateboard factories, US and European skateboard factories have
												spent a lot into the research of reducing production costs which has mostly happened through automation.<br>
												While this is not the case for all manufacturers, we see a trend of a few Chinese skateboard factories offering the best quality, while a few US and
												European manufacturers are leading in automation and the supply of small quantities.<br>
												<br>
												2HEX selects the one highest quality manufacturer for each product. The skateboard deck supplier of 2HEX arranges the production of over 60% of all professional skateboard
												deck brands which you can see riders use at Streetleague or XGames. This skateboard factory does not offer orders smaller than 10.000 decks, therefor only very few skateboard companies have
												access to their high quality skateboard deck production. 2HEX merges your order with thousands of other skateboard productions, to offer you the original factory price (or lower) at the world's highest
												quality skateboard deck manufacturer which you would otherwise not be able to access.
											</p>
											<br>
											<br>

											<p>
											<h2 style="font-size: 120%; color: #6610f2">Which are the best skateboard factories in the world?</h2>
											</p>
											<p>
												There are hundreds of skateboard factories world wide. However there are only very few skateboard factories offering
												a continuously high quality of pro level skateboard decks. These few factories are either very expensive or do not accept orders
												from small or medium sized skateboard companies. 2HEX makes sure that every order receives skateboard decks or other skateboard components
												as good as those used at Streetleague or the XGames. 2HEX also makes sure that these skateboard components are provided at a fair price, which enables companies
												to grow their business.<br>
												To get your order into one of the few world's best factories, 2HEX merges your order with thousand of other skateboard orders. This way the total quantity is higher than that
												of most pro brands and therefor receives the best prices within the best skateboard factories. We forward both to you: The best quality skateboard parts and the great prices for that high quality.
