											<h3>FAQ</h3>
											<br>
											<p>
												<b>What invoice currency does 2HEX use?</b><br>
												The invoice is provided in US Dollar.
											</p>

											<p>
												<b>Can I pay in Euro?</b><br>
												Yes, you can pay in Euro. In this case please contact us using the email address below, and we will change your invoice to Euro.
											</p>

											<p>
												<b>Can I pay by PayPal, Visa...?</b><br>
												We only accept bank wire transfers. PayPal or Credit Cards subtract up to 7% of the transferred amount for international transactions before the payment arrives on our account. If we were to offer these payment
												options, we would have to increase our price by 7% to cover these fees. That would be 700 USD more if you order for 10.000 USD. We believe that you rather work with your bank
												than pay 700 USD more for your production.

											</p>

											<p>
												<b>Can I split the payment?</b><br>
												Small orders of less than 10.000 USD need to be paid upfront. Orders of 10.000 USD or more get the following payment terms: 60% before production and 40% before shipping.
											</p>

											<p>
												<b>I did not receive an invoice by email?</b><br>
												Please send us your order number. You will find your order number above and our email address below.
											</p>

											<p>
												<b>Can I arrange a pick up?</b><br>
												Yes, you can. However 2HEX must export goods from China before handing them over.
												So if you choose to arrange a pick up of your goods, we must first export the goods to Hongkong. This local delivery and exportation costs 200 USD which have to be
												covered by the client. However if you find a cheaper shipping company than ours, you can introduce us to your shipping company and we will charge you the same that they charge us.
											</p>

											<p>
												<b>I have questions, how can I reach you?</b><br>
												Due to international time differences it is easiest to email us.
												Please add your phone number and country / city, so that we can call you back during your day time.<br>
